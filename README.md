# Rosalind-problems
These are my solutions for the bioinformatical puzzles posted on rosalind.info. For most of these I have been using Python 2, but some I have written in R. 

# Usage
Run the python scripts with ```python myscript.py```. In some scripts, a sample input is included in the script, e.g. a DNA sequence. In others, the input is read from a file (usually fasta or text). Likewise, the output of the script might be printed to the console or to a text file. You can get an appropriate dataset on the respective Rosalind problem page.
